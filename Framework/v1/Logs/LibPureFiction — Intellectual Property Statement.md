# LibPureFiction — Intellectual Property Strategy

**Status:** Proprietary / Internal  
**Author:** Adam  
**Date:** 2025

## 1. Purpose

LibPureFiction is a proprietary software framework designed to accelerate the development of Roblox-based games through a declarative, architecture-driven approach.

This document establishes:

- Ownership and authorship
- Legal protection posture
- AI-assisted development stance
- Short- and mid-term licensing intent

The goal is defensive clarity, not over-lawyering.

## 2. Authorship & Ownership

### 2.1 Human Authorship

LibPureFiction is a **human-authored software system**.

AI tools (including large language models such as Claude by :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}) are used solely as implementation assistants.

Adam is the:

- Systems architect  
- Framework designer  
- Module composer  
- API designer  
- Editor and final arbiter of all code  

All architectural decisions, abstractions, naming conventions, and system relationships originate from human direction.

---

### 2.2 AI-Assisted Code Generation

AI tools are used similarly to:

- Code editors  
- Autocomplete  
- Reference documentation  
- Syntax accelerators  

AI tools:

- Do not make independent design decisions  
- Do not select architecture  
- Do not determine system boundaries  
- Do not own or retain rights in outputs

## 3. Scope of Protected IP

### 3.1 Strongly Protected Elements

The following are core proprietary assets:

- Overall framework architecture  
- Module orchestration model  
- Declarative configuration patterns  
- Internal DSL concepts  
- Naming conventions and system vocabulary  
- Lifecycle timing and sequencing logic  
- Integration patterns across Server / Client / Shared contexts  
- Composition and arrangement of subsystems  

These elements are original, non-obvious, and curated, and constitute protectable intellectual property.

---

### 3.2 Weak or Non-Exclusive Elements

The following are acknowledged as industry-common and not claimed as exclusive:

- Generic Lua syntax  
- Roblox API usage  
- Common programming idioms  
- Standard event / observer patterns in isolation  

Protection is claimed over the system as a whole, not isolated lines of code.

---

## 4. Copyright Position

- LibPureFiction is protected as a collective work  
- Copyright vests in:
  - Selection  
  - Arrangement  
  - Coordination  
  - Architecture  

Human authorship is established through design control and editorial oversight.

Copyright registration may be pursued later if commercial exposure increases.

---

## 5. Trade Secret Posture (Active)

Until explicitly released otherwise, LibPureFiction is treated as a **trade secret**.

Reasonable measures include:

- Private repositories  
- Limited distribution  
- No public documentation of internal mechanics  
- Controlled sharing of concepts vs. implementation  

Trade secret protection applies to:

- Architecture  
- Internal mechanics  
- Design rationale  
- Non-public workflows  

This protection applies independently of copyright.

---

## 6. Licensing Intent (Non-Binding, Directional)

LibPureFiction is currently **closed-source and proprietary**.

Possible future paths (non-exclusive, subject to change):

- Dual-license (commercial + limited OSS)  
- Open-core model  
- Delayed open-source after competitive window  
- Contractor / framework-as-a-service usage  

No license is implied by access, discussion, or partial exposure.

---

## 7. Attribution & Public Statements

Public references should use language such as:

> “Built using AI-assisted development tools.”

Avoid:

- “Claude built this”  
- “Generated entirely by AI”  
- Any framing that implies non-human authorship  

This preserves clarity and defensibility.

---

## 8. Competitive Reality Statement (Internal)

The primary moat for LibPureFiction is not legal exclusivity.

It is:

- Architectural coherence  
- Taste and restraint  
- Iteration velocity  
- Developer ergonomics  
- Integration discipline  
- Practical application in shipped games  

Legal protection exists to support execution, not replace it.

---

## 9. Revision Policy

This document is living and may evolve alongside:

- Commercial exposure  
- External contributors  
- Open-source considerations  
- Partnership discussions  

Revisions should preserve the principle of **human authorship and architectural ownership**.
